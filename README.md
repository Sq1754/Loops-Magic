# Counting Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers

This Java program allows the user to enter numbers until they decide to exit. At the end, it displays the count of positive, negative, and zero numbers entered.

## Description

The `Q13_Loops.java` program prompts the user to continue entering numbers or exit. It then enters a loop where the user can input numbers. After each input, the program checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero and updates the respective counters. Once the user decides to exit, the program displays the count of positive, negative, and zero numbers entered.
